# How to contribute to Typo

The goal of this theme is to be as simple as possible, hence adding or changing existing features needs some thought.

Any change that is too niche or heavily tailored to a specific developer's need will be rejected, as that would make some features cumbersome to set up.

To avoid unnecessary work, please start a discussion or open an issue with a proposal.

**Guidelines**

Any other reasonable changes are more than welcome. Keep in mind the guidelines:

- keep the code as minimal as possible, and avoid comments in the code unless needed;
- keep the parameters (e.g. in hugo.toml) as concise and clear as possible;
- update the [wiki](https://github.com/tomfran/typo/tree/main/wiki) if needed, trying to maintain the current style of writing;
- squash your change in a single commit.

**On Breaking Changes**

You should avoid breaking existing configs when possible, or you should have a good reason to do so and explain it in your PR.

When introducing a styling change, aim to keep it disabled by default to avoid tweaking people's websites without config changes.
